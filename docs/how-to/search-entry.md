title: Search entry

The user can search for an entry using the magnifying glass icon at the top left of the main window. The search can also be accessed via a keyboard shortcut. By default this shortcut is `CTRL/CMD-U`.

Logseq searches the page titles and block contents for the entered string. The results appear directly below the search field as you type. A page is marked with a P, a block with a B. With the cursor keys up/down the user selects the desired entry and changes to this page or block by pressing the Enter key.

If Loqseq does not find an entry and the user completes his input with the Enter key, Loqseq creates a new page with this title.
