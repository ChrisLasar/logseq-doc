# Unofficial Logseq documentation

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## How to contribute as a developer

If you have some _technical skills_ (`git`, `yarn` or `npm`) you can consider documentation as code and might already know how to contribute. The following subsection are from the docusaurus scaffold and might be useful for a quickstart.

If you are a [non technical user](#how-to-contribute-as-a-non-technical-user), the easiest way to contribute might be on using the web ui of github.

### Installation

```console
yarn install
```

### Local Development

```console
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build (you might not need this)

```console
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment (you might not need this)

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Translations

I suggest to first have some content before wie think to mutch about translation. However, this documentation uses docusaurus 2.0 because I have a multiligual documentation in mind and docusaurus [supports](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/introduction) this using [crowdin](https://crowdin.com).
